\section{Background and Motivation}

\subsection{Motivation}
    Because everyone wants to trust their AIs, whether that be a single classification or regression algorithm, or a more interactive personal assistant that can understand language and communicate. Everyone wants to know how to trust these systems.  

    \paragraph{Why lay out AGI, when it doesn't exist yet?} Because this architecture is supposed to illustrate how the entire spectrum of AI from a single ML algorithm to an autonomous vehicle, to a full AGI operate on very similar grounds. That is that

        \label{fig:WhoCares}
    \end{sidewaysfigure}

    \paragraph{Science} Talk about why the science discplines care
    \paragraph{Robust Learning/Planning}
    \paragraph{HRI}
    \paragraph{Cognitive Assistance} 
    \paragraph{Government/Law} Regulations on the interpretability of certain algorithms, usage for assistants to lawyers.

    \textbf{Perhaps a table showing the field vs. the AI capability?}, this would help to illustrate the varying needs by fields. Perhaps highlight oversights?
