\section{Background and Motivation} \label{sec:background}

\subsection{Motivation}
    Because everyone wants to trust their AIs, whether that be a single classification or regression algorithm, or a more interactive personal assistant that can understand language and communicate. Everyone wants to know how to trust these systems.

    \end{sidewaysfigure}

    \paragraph{Interpretable Science} use data to find causes and insight
    \paragraph{Reliable AI} safety guarantees for robots that have been deployed in real-world environments
    \paragraph{Computer Science} Understand how algorithms will function on real data
    \paragraph{AI/ML} interpret how/why theoretical models function
    \paragraph{Robust Learning/Planning}
    \paragraph{Medicine} understand why data-driven models give predictions
    \paragraph{HCI} help humans and computers interact in a more natural way (where human-human relationships are typically the definition of normal)
    \paragraph{Cognitive Assistance} Ability for user to understand why information was presented
    \paragraph{Government/Law} Regulations on the interpretability of certain algorithms, usage for assistants to lawyers.

    \textbf{Perhaps a table showing the field vs. the AI capability?}, this would help to illustrate the varying needs by fields. Perhaps highlight oversights? \ldots Probably not, we aren't really interested in the different research fields.
