ideas that I want to communicate

1. The e-commerce, automation, and HRI groups
    * Have explicitly acknowledged `trust` as an important topic in their fields, and have referenced the standard trust works
    * E-commerce has referred to assurances as "trust-building mechanisms" and "vendor interventions" \cite{McKnight2001-fa,McKnight2002-qx}
    * Have *not* looked at active assurances, especially more advanced methods.
        * \cite{Freedy2007-sg}, possibly did this with the "information about the UGV [...] malfunctions"
        * \cite{Wang2016-vt}, use generated explanations of the robot logic. (cite papers that compare ways of communicating information)
        * \cite{Kaniarasu2013-ho}, have robot communicate confidence. Show that trust increases with feedback (assurances)
        * \cite{Dragan2013-wd}, has a robot give intentional assurances by its movements

2. The "ML disciplines" 
    * Have explicitly pursued intentional assurances
    * Throw the term `trust` around, but don't really have a well-founded meaning for it.
    * Intentional Assurances have been called "instrospection" and "perplexity" \cite{Grimmett2013-gj,Paul2011-vr}

* Interpretable \(\rightarrow\) Structure
* Competence \(\rightarrow\) Statistics
