\subsection{Assurances} \label{sec:assurances}
    The term assurances was introduced in the previous section as the name by which feedback will be known in a human-AIA trust relationship. As assurances are the main topic of this paper, and have received very little attention in trust literature, a more detailed definition and discussion is merited.

    \citet{McKnight2001-fa} allude to this kind of feedback in an e-commerce relationship as `Web Vendor Interventions' and mention some possible actions that might be used in that specific application. They go as far as making a diagram that indicates that these interventions could affect the `Trusting Beliefs', `Trusting Intentions', and `Trust-Related Behaviors' (see Figure \ref{fig:UserTrust}) of an online human user. \citet{Corritore2003-gx} refer to assurances as `trust cues' that can influence how online users trust vendors in an e-commerce setting. \citet{Lee2004-pv} discuss `display characteristics', which are methods by which an autonomous can communicate information to an operator. The term assurances is perhaps earliest used in the context of human-AIA relationships by \citet{Sheridan1984-kx}. More recently, and formally, \citet{Lillard2016-yg} defined the term `assurance', a more general definition is:    
    \begin{description}
        \item [Assurance:] A property or behavior of an AIA that affects a user's trust. As used here, the term is not intended to have a positive or negative connotation -- assurances can decrease trust.
    \end{description}

    Most researchers familiar with the fields of AI, ML, data science, and robotics will recognize terms like \emph{interpretable}, \emph{comprehensible}, \emph{transparent}, \emph{verified and validated} (V\&V), \emph{certified}, and \emph{explainable AI}, with respect to the models or performance of a designed system. A key claim of this paper is that from a high level all of these terms have the same aim: for a user to be able to trust an AIA to operate in a certain way, and based on that trust behave appropriately towards the AIA. They are therefore methods of assuring or calculating assurances to be given to a human user.

    Refined concepts about assurances are presented in section \ref{sec:assurances_refined}. This section takes into account material from the survey.

    % Assurances and `interpretability' are delicately linked. In fact, interpretability would be classified as one embodiment of an assurance. This relationship is highlighted by \citet{Vellido2012-nm} where they illustrate that interpreting an AIA is part of the knowledge discovery process.

    % The sections that follow outline different classes of assurances.
