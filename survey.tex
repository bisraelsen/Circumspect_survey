do survey stuff here

Possible: ``dimensions of assurances''?

\begin{itemize}
    \item intentional/unintentional
    \item atomic/composite
    \item source AIA behavior
    \item target trust variable
    \item methods from \cite{Lacave2002-cu} -- includes numerical information, 80\% success vs. 20\% failure, etc\ldots
\end{itemize}

need to add a lot of material. should have some kind of ``take-away'' graphic or table to summarize the overall findings of the survey.
