Whereas other researchers have noted the \textit{existence} of assurances, we now directly consider the question: what, exactly, \textit{are} assurances, and how can they be \textit{practically designed} into AIAs? 
This section surveys the related literature to understand what algorithmic approaches can be used to design AIA assurances. 

As discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:assurances} there are many different ways of classifying assurances. In evaluating different practical approaches to designing assurances we have found that it is easiest to consider the `level of integration' of the assurance in the AIA. The level of integration of an assurance refers to the extent to which the core functionality of the AIA is dependent on the existence of that assurance. Assurances naturally lie on a continuum between being totally integral to the core function of the AIA, and not being integral at all but being generated by artifacts of the underlying task or AIA functionality.  Figure~\ref{fig:assurance_continuum} illustrates this continuum. For simplicity we will sometimes refer generally to assurances as `integral' or `supplemental' based on whether they lie on the left or right side of the figure respectively~\footnote{Note that, while Fig.~\ref{fig:assurance_continuum} shows that the assurance classes occupy large spaces on the continuum, this is not referring to individual `component' assurances. An individual component assurance cannot be both integral and supplemental at the same time; it is located at a point on the continuum. This is not to say that an AIA cannot, simultaneously, have many assurances distributed over the assurance integration continuum, but that these assurances must be considered as separate.}. In the literature we have identified seven main categories for designed assurances that span this continuum.

Practically, understanding the level of integration of different assurances is useful because doing so can indicate at which point different assurances need to enter the design process. For example, an assurance that is integral to the AIA must necessarily be considered from early on in the design process, whereas one that is supplemental can feasibly be added much later. Also, assurances at different levels of integration have similarities in their affects; because of this designers may make different decisions regarding assurance design based on their specifications and goals.

While assurances cannot \emph{guarantee} appropriate TRBs from a user, integral assurances are generally built with the aim of intrinsically guaranteeing---as nearly as possible---certain effects on user trust and TRBs. In contrast, supplemental assurances are typically weaker, and \emph{encourage} appropriate TRBs; they rely much more on the uncertain relationships with human users. Problems can arise, for example, when a designer expects supplemental assurances to have the same effects on TRBs as those of integral assurances. This should generally not be expected. The remainder of this section is dedicated to discussing each of the seven categories in more detail.
