    Whereas others have noted the \textit{existence} of assurances, we now directly consider the question: what, exactly, \textit{are} assurances, and how can they be \textit{practically designed} into AIAs? 
    This section surveys the related literature to understand what algorithmic approaches can be used to design AIA assurances. \nisarcomm{for me todo: make sure this lines up with end of previous Assurances section in background}
    
    The algorithms use to generate assurances naturally lie on a continuum of `integration', which is the level to which the core functions of the AIA depend on the assurance; Figure~\ref{fig:assurance_continuum} illustrates this continuum. In the literature we have identified seven main categories for designed assurances. Within each category similar algorithms are used for design. These categories will each be defined and discussed in more detail in this section.

On the right are assurances that are not integral to performance; we call these `supplemental' as they are supplemental to the key functions of the AIA.}
