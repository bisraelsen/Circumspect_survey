\section{Survey of Methods for Calculating Assurances} \label{sec:synthesis}
    \brettcomm{BRING IN SOME MATERIAL FROM LIPTON, GUNNING, WELLER, AND DOSHI-VELEZ}
    The definition given in Section~\ref{sec:assurances} gives a good definition and classification of assurances, but doesn't give very many practical insights into how assurances might be designed. In this section we review the related literature to understand what approaches have been used in order to calculate assurances.
    
    Figure~\ref{fig:refined_assurances} combines material from Section~\ref{sec:definitions} in order to make a more detailed version of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. In this section we perform a survey of the methods of calculation that have been used in literature. We have distilled the common concepts down to the following different approaches that will be discussed further.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Integral Assurance
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Human-like Behavior
            \item Value Alignment
            \item Interpretable Models
            \item User Interaction
        \end{itemize}
        \item Supplemental Assurance
        \begin{itemize}
            \item User Assessment
            \item AIA Self-Assessment
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Quantify Uncertainty
                \item Reduce Complexity
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

        \caption{Detailed extension of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. The AIA, User, and User TRBs blocks are defined as in Section~\ref{sec:background} (with the exception of the `Perception' blocks added to the AIA and User boxes). The AIA Assurances box has been filled using insights from the survey. The grey shaded boxes will not be discussed in this work; we focus on elements that a designer can address given an AIA with a fixed set of capabilities.}
