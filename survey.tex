    %\brettcomm{BRING IN SOME MATERIAL FROM LIPTON, GUNNING, WELLER, AND DOSHI-VELEZ}
    %The definition given in Section~\ref{sec:assurances} gives a good definition and classification of assurances, but doesn't give very many practical insights into how assurances might be designed. 
    Whereas others have noted the \textit{existence} of assurances, we now directly consider the question: what, exactly, \textit{are} assurances, and how can they be \textit{practically designed} into AIAs? 
    This section surveys the related literature to understand what algorithmic approaches can be used to design AIA assurances. \nisarcomm{for me todo: make sure this lines up with end of previous Assurances section in background}
    
    \brettcomm{Insert discussion about `assurance integration continuum' here}
    % \nisarcomm{not sure about this parag - necessary??}
    % Figure~\ref{fig:refined_assurances} combines material from Section~\ref{sec:definitions} in order to make a more detailed version of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. In this section we perform a survey of the methods of calculation that have been used in literature. We have distilled the common concepts down to the following different approaches that will be discussed further.
