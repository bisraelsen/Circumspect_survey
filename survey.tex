\section{Survey of Methods for Calculating Assurances} \label{sec:synthesis}
    \brettcomm{BRING IN SOME MATERIAL FROM LIPTON, GUNNING, WELLER, AND DOSHI-VELEZ}
    The definition given in Section~\ref{sec:assurances} gives a good definition and classification of assurances, but doesn't give very many practical insights into how assurances might be designed. In this section we review the related literature to understand what approaches have been used in order to calculate assurances.
    
    Figure~\ref{fig:refined_assurances} combines material from Section~\ref{sec:definitions} in order to make a more detailed version of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. In this section we perform a survey of the methods of calculation that have been used in literature. We have distilled the common concepts down to the following different approaches that will be discussed further.
