\section{A Synthesized and Refined View of Assurances} \label{sec:synthesis}
    \brettcomm{BRING IN SOME MATERIAL FROM LIPTON, GUNNING, WELLER, AND DOSHI-VELEZ}
    The definition given in Section~\ref{sed:assurances} doesn't give very many practical insights into how assurances can be designed. Review of relevant literature provides more details about what assurances are and how they have been designed.
    
    The main result of this survey is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:refined_assurances}, which is a more detailed version of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. It adds some detailed elements from Section~\ref{sec:background}, and incorporates ideas from the body of literature that has been surveyed. Below we discuss each of the boxes in Figure~\ref{fig:refined_assurances} that have a white background.

        \caption{Detailed extension of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. The AIA, User, and User TRBs blocks are defined as in Section~\ref{sec:background} (with the exception of the `Perception' blocks added to the AIA and User boxes). The AIA Assurances box has been filled using insights from the survey. The dark grey boxes will not be discussed; we focus on elements that a designer can address given an AIA with a fixed set of capabilities.}
