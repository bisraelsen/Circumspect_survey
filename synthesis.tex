\section{A Synthesized and Refined View of Assurances} \label{sec:synthesis}
    \brettcomm{BRING IN SOME MATERIAL FROM LIPTON, GUNNING, WELLER, AND DOSHI-VELEZ}
    The definition given in Section~\ref{sec:assurances} doesn't give very many practical insights into how assurances might be designed. We now present a more detailed definition of assurances based on fundamental theory presented in Section~\ref{sec:background}, and surveyed literature representing a subset of the relevant research taking place in this domain. The main result of this survey is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:refined_assurances}, which is a more detailed version of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. In the remainder of this section we discuss each of the boxes in Figure~\ref{fig:refined_assurances} that are not shaded gray.

        \caption{Detailed extension of Figure~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. The AIA, User, and User TRBs blocks are defined as in Section~\ref{sec:background} (with the exception of the `Perception' blocks added to the AIA and User boxes). The AIA Assurances box has been filled using insights from the survey. The grey shaded boxes will not be discussed in this work; we focus on elements that a designer can address given an AIA with a fixed set of capabilities.}
