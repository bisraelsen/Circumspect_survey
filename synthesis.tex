\section{A Refined View of Assurances} \label{sec:synthesis}
    From the review of Quadrants I. through IV. of the formal/informal, explicit/implicit plane (see figure \ref{fig:trust_assurance_intention}), we are able to find some insights with respect to assurances and can discuss them in a more comprehensive way. Using the surveyed papers as a guide, a more detailed look at the path from the AIA to the User can be constructed. Figure \ref{fig:assurance_path} shows some of the key steps between an AIA source capability, and a user trust target.

\subsection{Classes of Assurances}
    Given the considerations discussed above, we can make some attempt at classifying assurances.
