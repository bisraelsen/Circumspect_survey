# My Proposed Framework
## Work that alludes to some of the same ideas:

* Assurances
    * "trust-building mechanisms" and "vendor interventions" \cite{McKnight2001-fa,McKnight2002-qx}
    * intentional vs. unintentional \cite{Sheridan1984-kx}
    * intentional \cite{Lillard2016-yg,Aitken2016-cv}
    * Use the word assurance \cite{Sheridan1984-kx}
    * low-level and high-level assurances (atomic and composite) \cite{Sheridan1984-kx}
    * "cues" \cite{Corritore2003-gx}
    * Assurances are the feedback, how should they be designed? \cite{Lillard2016-yg}
    * Influence of "display characteristics" \cite{Lee2004-pv}
* Aligning trust for appropriate usage
    * Use, misuse, abuse (and implied appropriate use) of automation \cite{Parasuraman1997-co} 
    * appropriate use \cite{Muir1987-mk}
    * calibration of trust \cite{Muir1994-ow,Muir1987-mk}
    * "proper development of trust" \cite{Lillard2016-yg}
    * rely appropriately on automation, "calibrate trust",  \cite{Lee2004-pv}
* Use of trust model
    * \cite{McKnight2001-fa} -- validate the model and gave correlations between dimensions of trust in \cite{McKnight2002-qx}
    * \cite{Corritore2003-gx}
    * 
* Human-Machine Trust
    * \cite{Muir1987-mk}
    * \cite{Lillard2016-yg}
    * \cite{Lee2004-pv} - cites studies that support human-machine trust exists
    * \cite{Groom2007-bz}, and Reeves and Naas 1996 show people can treat technology as a person
* The elusive and undefined "trust"
    * put some of the papers here that talk about needing people to trust stuff
    * \cite{Lipton2017-zw,Lipton2016-ug,Lipton2016-dq}
    * \cite{Grimmett2013-gj,Triebel_undated-ku,Triebel2013-ow,Triebel2016-kj,Grimmett2016-yc}
    * In popular media: \cite{Goodrum_2016-fm,noauthor_undated-bb,Ghahramani2015-yq,Castelvecchi2016-mr,Khosravi2016-ke,noauthor_2016-nm,noauthor_2016-jp}
* Unacknowledged Need For Trust or Methods that can be used for assurances
    * a table of where decision support is needed, could be used as a table of when assurances are needed \cite{Rouse1986-dz}
