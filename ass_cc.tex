\emph{Component and Composite:}
A component assurance is an assurance that describes a single AIA capability (or one aspect of an AIA model/process for a capability), and targets one or more trust dimension targets.  Component assurances are the most well researched in the existing literature. A component assurance might include displaying the confidence of a classification prediction, or visualizing a model. A composite assurance is the combination of more than one component assurance into a single assurance. 
A notable example is the machine self-confidence work by \citet{Aitken2016-cv} which notionally combines five component assurances into a single composite assurance that a non-expert AIA user can easily and interpret. 

Figure \ref{fig:assurance_mapping} illustrates the concepts of component and composite assurances. Some open questions here are: how can component assurances generally be combined to create a composite one? Also, to what extent can component and composite assurances be used in concert to provide assurances for users of differing expertise? And, are the effects of a composite assurance equal to the sum of its components?
