\subsubsection{Component and Composite}
Assurances can be either component or composite:

A component assurance is an assurance that originates from a single AIA capability source, and targets a single trust dimension target. Component assurances are perhaps the most well researched in the existing literature. A component assurance might include displaying the confidence of a classification prediction, or visualizing a model.

A composite assurance is the combination of more than one component assurance into a single assurance. Composite assurances are assurances that are built of several component ones. A notable example is the work by \citet{Aitken2016-cv} who propose a measurement called `self-confidence', applicable to Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). They propose that this metric combine five component assurances into a single composite assurance that is meant to distill the information into a value that a novice operator could understand easily.

Figure \ref{fig:assurance_mapping} illustrates the concepts of component and composite assurances. Some possible research questions include: How can component assurances be combined? To what extent can component and composite assurances be used in concert to provide assurances for users of differing expertise?
