\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusions}
    Revisit the key ideas of the paper:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item trust is a key factor for human-agent interaction
        \item many fields care about it
        \item some fields have considered the effect of unintentional assurances on a user's trust (automation, HCI, e-commerce)
        \item some fields have considered intentional assurances, but have not explicitly used a formal trust definition (robotics, ML, medicine)
    \end{itemize}

    discuss opportunities for future research in assurances.
