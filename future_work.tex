\brettcomm{Add more stuff about avenues for future work}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Draw from other disciplines that have `useful' tools. (stuff from old Q4)
    \item How to know if assurances are effective. Are explicit assurances being perceived as desired? Are implicit assurances overpowering?
    \item component and composite assurances. What happens when assurances are combined vs. when they exist in isolation? How should assurances be combined?
    \item methods, and modes of expression. What human limitations must be considered
    \item from the perspective of AIAs are there assurances that exist for each of the capabilities that can communicate to the different trust targets?
    \item currently assurances are typically `displayed' as static information to a user, can a user be taught over time by planning assurances?
    \item what cognitive effects inhib assurances
    \item how to select the expression of an assurance? Easy to calculate hard to communicate\ldots
    \item measuring effects of assurances
    \item distrust
    \item two-way trust
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distrust}
The treatment of assurances in this survey is based, in part, on a model of interpersonal trust. For completeness it is important to mention the concept of \textit{distrust}, as reviewed and discussed by \citet{Lewicki1998-ox}, and formalized in \citet{McKnight2001-gz}. Low trust is not the same as distrust, and low distrust is not the same as trust. \citet{McKnight2001-gz} suggest that ``the emotional intensity of distrust distinguishes it from trust'', and they explain that distrust comes from emotions like: wariness, caution, and fear. Whereas, trust stems from emotions like: hope, safety, and confidence. Trust and distrust are orthogonal elements that define a person's TRB towards a trustee. In this survey, distrust was not considered. However it must be made clear that any \emph{complete} treatment of trust relationships, and for our purposes, designed assurances, must consider the dimensions of distrust as well as those of trust. For now, this is left as an avenue for future research (one yet to be picked up by mainstream AIA researchers).
