\section{Future Work} \label{sec:future_work}
The body of research that is encapsulated by assurances is very large. As such, this document can barely scratch the surface. Having said that the concepts that have been discussed lead to many interesting lines of research that can be pursued in future work. Here we highlight some of those.

\brettcomm{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Draw from other disciplines that have `useful' tools. (stuff from old Q4)
    \item How to know if assurances are effective. Are explicit assurances being perceived as desired? Are implicit assurances overpowering?
    \item component and composite assurances. What happens when assurances are combined vs. when they exist in isolation? How should assurances be combined?
    \item methods, and modes of expression. What human limitations must be considered
    \item from the perspective of AIAs are there assurances that exist for each of the capabilities that can communicate to the different trust targets?
    \item currently assurances are typically `displayed' as static information to a user, can a user be taught over time by planning assurances?
    \item what cognitive effects inhib assurances
    \item how to select the expression of an assurance? Easy to calculate hard to communicate\ldots
    \item measuring effects of assurances
    \item distrust
    \item two-way trust
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Properties of Assurances}
First we can draw some guidance from Figure~\ref{fig:assurance_classification}, which shows how to classify an assurance.

\subsection{Trust vs. Distrust}
The treatment of assurances in this survey is based, in part, on a model of interpersonal trust. For completeness it will be important to further investigate \textit{distrust}, as reviewed and discussed by \citet{Lewicki1998-ox}, and formalized in \citet{McKnight2001-gz}. Low trust is not the same as distrust, and low distrust is not the same as trust. \citet{McKnight2001-gz} suggest that `the emotional intensity of distrust distinguishes it from trust', and they explain that distrust comes from emotions like: wariness, caution, and fear. Whereas, trust stems from emotions like: hope, safety, and confidence. Trust and distrust are orthogonal elements that define a person's TRB towards a trustee. In this survey, distrust was not considered. However it must be made clear that any \emph{complete} treatment of trust relationships, and for our purposes, designed assurances, must consider the dimensions of distrust as well as those of trust. Based on the emotions that drive distrust it will be important to consider in higher-risk human-AIA relationships.

\subsection{Cognitive Limitations}
This was directly observed in \cite{Freedy2007-sg,Riley1996-qm}, where framing effects biased operator's behaviors towards the AIAs. 
Other cognitive biases such as `recency effects' (being biased based on recent experience), `focusing effects' (being biased based on a single aspect of an event), or `normalcy biases' (refusal to consider situations which have never occurred before) are also important to consider. 
\citet{Riley1996-qm}In this setting, the bias to use more automation would be known as `framing effects' (where a human's trust is biased by the trust they have in previously encountered systems) in cognitive science. Findings also showed that the use of automation is highly based on individual traits.
Other discussion regarding how probabilistic and statistical explanations can be presented is found in \cite{Rouse1986-dz,Wallace2001-fm,Kuhn1997-qc,Lomas2012-ie,Swartout1983-ko}; 
aforementioned works like \cite{Kuhn1997-qc} highlight the importance of framing effects and other cognitive biases for these methods.
