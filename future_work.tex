Add stuff about avenues for future work

The treatment of assurances in this survey is based, in part, on a model of interpersonal trust. For completeness it is important to mention the concept of \textit{distrust}, as reviewed and discussed by \citet{Lewicki1998-ox}, and formalized in \citet{McKnight2001-gz}. Low trust is not the same as distrust, and low distrust is not the same as trust. \citet{McKnight2001-gz} suggest that ``the emotional intensity of distrust distinguishes it from trust'', and they explain that distrust comes from emotions like: wariness, caution, and fear. Whereas, trust stems from emotions like: hope, safety, and confidence. Trust and distrust are orthogonal elements that define a person's TRB towards a trustee. In this survey, distrust was not considered. However it must be made clear that any \emph{complete} treatment of trust relationships, and for our purposes, designed assurances, must consider the dimensions of distrust as well as those of trust. For now, this is left as an avenue for future research (one yet to be picked up by mainstream AIA researchers).
