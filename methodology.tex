\section{Methodology} \label{sec:methodology}
    Discussing the 
    In this paper I am focusing on a human-autonomy relationship between a single human user (User), and a single autonomous system (Autonomy). Furthermore, I will only be considering a one-way trust relationship, that is that the autonomy has perfect trust towards a user and that trust does not change with time. 

    here are the assumptions:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item 1:1 relationship (i.e. not groups)
        \item Focus on Belief and Behavior classes (faster time scale)
        \item Autonomy is honest and friendly
        \item others \ldots
        \item assume that the AI has a better idea of true distribution than the user (AI, may also need to learn with experience)
    \end{itemize}

    There is previous work regarding autonomy. Also e-commerce.

    Why this survey? to look back (again), and to get a unifying trust model and also to make a framework to be applied over the spectrum of  AIAs automation to robots, algorithms to AIs.

    Approach: Solidify trust literature wrt AIAs, survey different fields/disciplines to identify existing algorithms that are currently being used to affect TRBs.
