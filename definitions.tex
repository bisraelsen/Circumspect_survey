\subsubsection*{Summary}
Each of the elements of Fig.~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way} has been defined in this Section (\ref{sec:trust_definitions}). Figure~\ref{fig:refined_trust} illustrates how these concepts fit together. In this document algorithmic assurances are surveyed through the lens of their `Level of Integration'; more detailed discussion of the other elements are found in Sec.~\ref{sec:future_work}.
