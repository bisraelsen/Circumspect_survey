\subsubsection*{Summary}
Here in Section~\ref{sec:trust_definitions} we have defined each of the elements of Fig.~\ref{fig:SimpleTrust_one_way}. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:refined_trust}. In this document we survey algorithmic assurances through the lens of their `Level of Integration', and leave more detailed discussion of the other elements for future work.
