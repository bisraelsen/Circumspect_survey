\subsection{AIA Self-Assessment} \label{sec:aia_self_assessment}

\subsubsection{Common Approaches:}
The literature in this category can be split into two high-level categories. The first concern is for an AIA to be able to account for its uncertanties (i.e. uncertainty in its models of its world, sensors, and capabilities). The second is to attempt to reduce its complex, `uninterpretable', capabilities into more interpretable ones.

Here the AIA makes an active attempt at processing data and making information available to the user. This is done in a post-hoc manner, or in a way such that the quantification of uncertainty is more supplemental, rather than integral, to the main functions of the AIA.

\subsubsection{Grounding Example:}
In the case of the `VIP Escort' problem (described in Section~\ref{sec:mot_example}), self-assessment might be used as an assurance in the following way:

We make the following assumptions

\begin{itemize}
    \item The UGV is about to being an attempt to escape the road-network
    \item The UGV is using the `solver quality' metric mentioned by \citet{Aitken2016-fb}
    \item The operator has access to an interface where they can view the self-confidence metric calculated by the UGV
\end{itemize}

Before the UGV begins its attempt it is able to assess its `solver quality' given the specific, unseen road-network, based on similarities between the current network and ones that it has encountered before. The UGV reports that it has high confidence in its solver quality, and the operator is assured that they can trust the solver in this situation.

\paragraph{\textbf{Discussion of Example:}} In this case the UGV is able to assure the operator of the quality of the solver in the specific road-network. Generally, the UGV reduced what could be a very complex analysis into a simple format for the operator to interpret. This is in contrast to the operator viewing policies, models, algorithms, and complex probability distributions.
