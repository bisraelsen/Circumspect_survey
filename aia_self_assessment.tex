\subsection{AIA Self-Assessment} \label{sec:aia_self_assessment}

\subsubsection{Common Approaches:}
The literature in this category can be split into two high-level categories. The first approach is for the AIA to quantify the uncertainty it is dealing with (i.e. uncertainty in its models of its world, sensors, and capabilities). The second is to attempt to reduce its complex, `uninterpretable', capabilities into more interpretable ones.

\subsubsection{Grounding Example:}
In the case of the `VIP Escort' problem (described in Section~\ref{sec:mot_example}), value alignment might be used as an assurance in the following way:

We make the following assumptions

\begin{itemize}
    \item The UGV has just begun an attempt to escape the road-network
    \item 
    \item 
\end{itemize}
