\subsection{AIA Self-Assessment} \label{sec:aia_self_assessment}

\subsubsection{Common Approaches:}
The literature in this category can be split into two high-level categories. The first concern is for an AIA to be able to account for its uncertanties (i.e. uncertainty in its models of its world, sensors, and capabilities). The second is to attempt to reduce its complex, `uninterpretable', capabilities into more interpretable ones.

Here the AIA makes an active attempt at processing data and making information available to the user. This is done in a post-hoc manner, or in a way such that the quantification of uncertainty is more supplemental, rather than integral, to the main functions of the AIA.

\subsubsection{Grounding Example:}
In the case of the `VIP Escort' problem (described in Section~\ref{sec:mot_example}), self-assessment might be used as an assurance in the following way:

We make the following assumptions

\begin{itemize}
    \item The UGV has just begun an attempt to escape the road-network
    \item 
    \item 
\end{itemize}
